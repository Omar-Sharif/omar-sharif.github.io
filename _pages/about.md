Currently, I am working as a Lecturer at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">(CUET)</a>. I am also pursuing my M.Sc. from CUET under the supervision of <a href="https://cuetnlp.com/people/"> Dr. Moshiul Hoque</a> and a member of the <a href="https://cuetnlp.com/people/"> CUET NLP Lab</a>. My research interest lies in the intersection of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval. More precisely, my goal is to develop tools that help to present information in a structured way by considering inherent semantic relations and dependencies. Some of the areas I wish to work on are textual aggression detection and classification, sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, summarization, question answering, and multimodal NLP.

Previously, I did my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from CUET with a CGPA of 3.90. I love to work with Data structures and Algorithms. Throughout my academic career, I have participated in ICPC, NCPC, and numerous national-level programming contest. While working on academic and extracurricular projects, I develop my skill in C, C++, Python, Java, Php, and Latex. Working on several group projects help me to get communication as well as planning skills. I love to play a lot, read motivational and history (religion, world war) books. My favorite sports are badminton, football, and cricket. Occasionally, I play carrom, chess, and card as well.
